# RASPI_STREAMBOT

This project was started to help connect friends at a distance for board game nights. Sure, you can set up computers with webcams and stream over any meeting software of your choice. My main requirement was an all-in-one solution that a non-technical person could use.

A work in progress!

- RPI 4b 4GB
